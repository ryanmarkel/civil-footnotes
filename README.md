# Marginal
Marginal starts life as a GitHub fork of Civil Footnotes for WordPress.

Pull requests are welcome, but I may not be able to get to them on a regular basis. I also can't yet promise that I know what I'm doing.

The goal for this repo is to take the Civil Footnotes syntax and add Bigfoot support for inline footnote support. Considering new syntax if it makes sense but it will always be backwards-compatibile. (Mostly because I need it to be.)

If you know of a better footnoting plugin that will also accept this syntax, or if I know you and you are interested in contributing to this repository, please contact me.
