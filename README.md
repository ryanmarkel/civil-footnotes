# civil-footnotes
This is a GitHub fork of Civil Footnotes for WordPress.

You can find the base repo copy [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/). Pull requests are welcome, but I may not be able to get to them on a regular basis.

If you know of a better footnoting plugin that will also accept this syntax, or if I know you and you are interested in contributing to this repository, please contact me.
